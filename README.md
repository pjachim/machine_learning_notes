# Machine Learning Notes

These are going to contain a series of notebooks that I am creating from memory of machine learning and statistics techniques so that I can start finding more gaps in my knowledge of basic techniques. I hope to make a simple implementation of each technique on a small dataset. 

Here is a list of techniques that I hope to cover:
 - Bayesian Statistics:
  - Naive Bayes
 - Regression Analysis
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Trees
 - Support Vector Machines
 - Principal Component Analysis
 - Factor Analysis
 - TF-IDF
 - Boosting
 - Bagging
